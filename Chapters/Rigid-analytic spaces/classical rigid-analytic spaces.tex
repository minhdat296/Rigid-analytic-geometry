\section{Classical rigid-analytic spaces}
    \begin{convention} \label{conv: rigid_analytic_varieties_non_archimedean_ground_field}
        Henceforth, we fix a \textit{complete}\footnote{This is an important hypothesis because eventually, we will want out affinoid algebras to be instances of Banach algebra over $K$ (cf. proposition \ref{prop: affinoid_algebras_are_banach_algebras}).} non-archimedean field $(K, |-|)$ valuation ring $K^{\circ} := \{x \in K \mid |x| \leq 1\}$ and residue field $k := K^{\circ}/\m$, where $\m := \{x \in K \mid |x| < 1\}$ is the unique maximal ideal of $K^{\circ}$. In addition, we will be caring about the value group of $K$ (or rather, of $K^{\circ}$), which comes from the valuation $v: K^{\x} \to \R$ that determines the non-archimedean ultra-metric $|-| := \exp(v(-))$, and is given by $\Gamma := \im v$ (note that this is well-defined because $v: K^{\x} \to \R$ is a group homomorphism); this is a totally ordered abelian group whose ordering is inherited from the archimedean ordering of $(\R, \leq)$.
    \end{convention}

            \begin{remark}
                In addition, recall that the valuation ring $K^{\circ}$ is Noetherian if and only if the value group $\Gamma$ is a discrete subgroup of $\R$; in which case, $K^{\circ}$ will be a discrete valuation ring.
            \end{remark}
            
            \begin{convention}[Multi-indices] \label{conv: mutli_indices}
                Fix a positive integer $n$. An \textbf{$n$-multi-index} is an ordered $n$-tuple $J := (j_1, ..., j_n) \in \N^n$. By $|J|$, we shall mean $\sum_{i = 1}^n j_i$ and for any ordered $n$-tuple of variables $X := (x_1, ..., x_n)$ we shall write $X^J := \prod_{i = 1}^n x_i^{j_i}$.
            \end{convention}
            \begin{definition}[Tate algebras and affinoid algebras] \label{def: affinoid_algebras}
                Let $n$ be a fixed positive integer and let $X := (x_1, ..., x_n)$ be an $n$-tuple of variables. The \textbf{$n^{th}$ Tate $K$-algebra}, denoted by $K\{X\} := K\{x_1, ..., x_n\}$, is the $K$-subalgebra\footnote{We will let the readers check for themselves that $K\{X\}$ is a $K$-subalgebra of $K[\![X]\!]$.} of $K[\![X]\!] := K[\![x_1, ..., x_n]\!]$ whose elements are the convergent\footnote{Recall that a non-archimedean power series $\sum_{|J| = 0}^{+\infty} a_J X^J$ with coefficients $a_J \in K$ converges if and only if the coefficients $a_J$ are topologically nilpotent.} power series $\sum_{|J| = 1}^{+\infty} a_J X^J$ with coefficients $a_J \in K$. This is naturally a normed algebra via the so-called \textbf{Gauss norm}, which is given by $\left\|\sum_{|J| = 0}^{+\infty} a_J X^J\right\| := \sup_J |a_J|$ and well-defined because non-archimedean convergent power series must have topologically nilpotent (hence bounded) coefficients; obviously $\|f\| = 0$ if and only if $f = 0$.
                
                An \textbf{affinoid $K$-algebra} is a quotient of a Tate $K$-algebra by an ideal thereof (i.e. Tate algebras are \say{free} affinoid algebras). 
            \end{definition}
            
            Before we move on, let us first recall several aspects of the theory of Banach spaces over non-archimedean fields, mostly to be clear about what we specfically mean by such \say{Banach spaces}.
            \begin{definition}[Non-archimedean Banach spaces] \label{def: non_archimedean_banach_spaces}
                A \textbf{non-archimedean $K$-vector space} is a $K$-vector space equipped with an ultra-norm. A \textbf{Banach space} over $K$ is a topologically complete non-archimedean $K$-vector space.
            \end{definition}
            \begin{definition}[Bounded linear maps] \label{def: bounded_linear_maps_between_non_archimedean_vector_spaces}
                A $K$-linear map $\varphi: V \to W$ between two non-archimedean $K$-vector spaces $V, W$ is said to be \textbf{bounded} if and only if there exists $C \geq 0$ such that $\|\varphi(v)\| \leq C \|v\|$ for all $v \in V$.
            \end{definition}
            \begin{remark}
                It is easy to check that the identity map on any non-archimedean $K$-vector space is bounded, and furthermore, that the boundedness of $K$-linear maps between non-archimedean $K$-vector spaces preserved under compositions.
            \end{remark}
            \begin{proposition}
                A $K$-linear map between two non-archimedean $K$-vector spaces is bounded if and only if it is continuous with respect to the topologies induced by the ultra-norms on the codomain and domain.
            \end{proposition}
                \begin{proof}
                    
                \end{proof}
            \begin{corollary}
                There is a category of (non-archimedean) $K$-Banach spaces, which we denote by $K\Ban$, whose objects are $K$-Banach spaces and whose morphisms are the continuous (i.e. bounded) $K$-linear maps.
            \end{corollary}
            \begin{definition}[Completed tensor products] \label{def: completed_tensor_products_of_non_archimedean_vector_spaces}
                The \textbf{completed tensor product} (also known as the \textbf{projective tensor product}) $V \hat\tensor_K W$ of two non-archimedean $K$-vector spaces $V$ and $W$ is the topological completion of the algebraic tensor product $V \tensor_K W$ with respect to the so-called \textbf{projective cross ultra-norm}, which for elements $x := \sum_{i = 1}^n v_i \tensor w_i \in V \tensor_K W$ is given by:
                    $$\|x\|_{\pi} := \inf\left\{ \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} \|v_i\|_V \|w_i\|_W \right\}$$
            \end{definition}
            \begin{remark}
                Of course, one ought to check that the projective cross ultra-norm as in definition \ref{def: completed_tensor_products_of_non_archimedean_vector_spaces} is indeed a well-defined ultra-norm. This, however, is easy and as such will be left to our readers as an exercise.  
            \end{remark}
            \begin{proposition}[Completed tensor products of non-archimedean Banach spaces] \label{prop: completed_tensor_products_of_non_archimedean_banach_spaces}
                The category $K\Ban$ is an infinite tensor category\footnote{This is as in \cite[Definition 4.1.1]{EGNO}, but without the local finiteness condition. In particular, this means that $K\Ban$ is symmetric monoidal, rigid, and closed with respect to the completed tensor product of non-archimedean $K$-vector spaces.} whose monoidal structure is the completed tensor product $\hattensor_K$ of non-archimedean $K$-vector spaces.
            \end{proposition}
                \begin{proof}
                    
                \end{proof}
            \begin{corollary}
                There exists a category of commutative Banach $K$-algebras internal to $K\Ban$, whose objects are the commutative monoids internal to $K\Ban$ and whose morphisms are the continuous (i.e. bounded) $K$-algebra homomorphisms between them. This category shall be denoted by $K\Ban\Comm\Alg$. 
            \end{corollary}
            
            \begin{lemma}[Quotients of non-archimedean Banach spaces] \label{lemma: quotients_of_non_archimedean_banach_spaces}
                Let $V$ be a $K$-Banach space and $V_0 \subseteq V$ be a closed $K$-vector subspace thereof. Then $V/V_0$ will also be a $K$-Banach space. 
            \end{lemma}

            \begin{lemma}[Ideals of Tate algebras are closed] \label{lemma: tate_algebra_ideals_are_closed}
                Ideals inside Tate algebras are closed with respect to the topology induced by the Gauss norm.
            \end{lemma}
                \begin{proof}
                    
                \end{proof}
            \begin{proposition}[Affinoid algebras are Banach algebras] \label{prop: affinoid_algebras_are_banach_algebras}
                Affinoid algebras are Banach $K$-algebras when equipped with the Gauss norm (note that this relies crucially on the assumption that $K$ is complete as a non-archimedean field).
            \end{proposition}
                \begin{proof}
                    Thanks to lemma \ref{lemma: quotients_of_non_archimedean_banach_spaces} and \ref{lemma: tate_algebra_ideals_are_closed}, it suffices to only prove that any given Tate algebra $K\{x_1, ..., x_n\}$ (for any positive integer $n$) is a Banach $K$-algebra with respect to the topology induced by the Gauss norm; in fact, because $K\{x_1, ..., x_n\} \cong K\{x_1\} \hattensor_K ... \hattensor_K K\{x_n\}$. For this, pick a Cauchy sequence $\{f_i\}_{i \in \N}$ of single-variable convergent power series $f_i(x) := \sum_{d = 0}^{+\infty} a_d^{(i)} x^d \in K\{x\}$ and observe that because:
                        $$\|f_i(x) - f_j(x)\| = \left\| \sum_{d = 0}^{+\infty} (a_d^{(i)} - a_d^{(j)}) x^d \right\| = \sup_d \|a_d^{(i)} - a_d^{(i)}\|$$
                    the sequence of coefficients $\{a_d^{(i)}\}_{i \in \N}$ is also Cauchy at each degree $d \geq 0$ as a result of the assumption that $\{f_i\}_{i \in \N}$ is Cauchy. Because $K$ is complete by hypothesis, the sequences of coefficients $\{a_d^{(i)}\}_{i \in \N}$ all converge by virtue of being Cauchy. Now, observe that:
                        $$\underset{i \to +\infty}{\lim} f_i(x) = \underset{i \to +\infty}{\lim} \sum_{d = 0}^{+\infty} a_d^{(i)} x^d = \sum_{d = 0}^{+\infty} \left( \underset{i \to +\infty}{\lim} a_d^{(i)} \right) x^d$$
                    per some elementary non-archimedean analysis. As such, the sequence $\{f_i\}_{i \in \N}$ is convergent, and since it is an arbitrary Cauchy sequence, means that $K\{x\}$ (and by extension, any Tate $K$-algebra $K\{x_1, ..., x_n\}$) is complete with respect to the topology induced by the Gauss norm. 
                \end{proof}
            \begin{corollary}
                There is a full subcategory of the category $K\Ban\Comm\Alg$ of commutative Banach $K$-algebras and continuous $K$-algebra homomorphisms, wherein the objects are affinoid $K$-algebras. This category shall be denoted by $K\-\Affd$.
            \end{corollary}
            \begin{proposition}[Maximal spectra of affinoid algebras] \label{prop: maximal_spectra_of_affinoid_algebras}
                There is a functor: $\Spm: K\-\Affd \to \Sets$ which associates to each affinoid $K$-algebra $A$ the set $\Spm A$ whose elements are the maximal ideals of $A$. 
            \end{proposition}

                An affinoid $K^{\circ}$-algebra $A \cong K^{\circ}\{x_1, ..., x_n\}$ is said to be \textbf{topologically of finite presentation} (often abbreviated to \textbf{tfp}) if and only if the ideal $I$ is finitely generated\footnote{Note that being algebraically finitely generated and being topologically so are the same for ideals of affinoid algebras, since they are closed.} as a $K^{\circ}\{x_1, ..., x_n\}$-module.

                An affinoid $K^{\circ}$-algebra that is topologically of finite type is said to be \textbf{admissible} over $K^{\circ}$ if and only if it is flat as a $K^{\circ}$-module.

                Let us compare definitions \ref{def: admissible_affinoid_algebras} and \ref{def: pre_admissible_and_pre_adic_rings}: specifically, we would like to know if the notion of admissibility for affinoid algebras coincides with (or at least, is closedly related to) that of linearly topologised rings.
