        \begin{convention}
            Throughout this entire subsection, we work within the tensor category $\bbC\Ban$ of complex Banach spaces. In particular, terms like \say{Banach space} or \say{Banach algebra} shall always be understood to be over $\bbC$. 
        \end{convention}
        
        \subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{$C^*$}{}-algebras}
            \begin{example}
                Before we begin our study of $C^*$-algebras, let us point out certain common complex Banach algebras:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{(Bounded continuous functions):} If $X$ is a compact topological space then the $\bbC$-algebra:
                            $$C^0(X) := \Maps(X, \bbC)$$
                        of complex-valued continuous functions on $X$ will be a Banach algebra with respect to the sup-norm, given by $\|f\|_{\infty} := \sup_{x \in X} |f(x)|$. When $X$ is non-compact, we can not apply the Extreme Value Theorem to guarantee that $\sup_{x \in X} |f(x)|$ shall always be a finite non-negative real number, and therefore $\|\cdot\|_{\infty}: X \to \R_{\geq 0}$ might fail to be a norm; of course, one can always restrict one's attention to the $\bbC$-subalgebra:
                            $$C^b(X) := \Maps^b(X, \bbC)$$
                        of bounded complex-valued continuous functions on $X$ (i.e. functions $f: X \to \bbC$ such that $|f(x)| < +\infty$ for all $x \in X$) 
                        \item \textbf{(Bounded operators):}
                        \item \textbf{($L^1$-functions on locally compact groups):}
                    \end{itemize}
            \end{example}
