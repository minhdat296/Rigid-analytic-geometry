                If $\C$ and $\D$ are two monoidal categories, then:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item $\Mon\Func(\C, \D)$ shall be used to denote the (monoidal) category of (strong) monoidal functors from $\C$ to $\D$,
                        \item $\Mon\Func^{\co\cont}(\C, \D)$ shall denote the (monoidal) category of cocontinuous\footnote{I.e. functors that preserve colimits.} (strong) monoidal functors from $\C$ to $\D$,
                        \item $\Mon\Func^{\co\cont}_{\comp}(\C, \D)$ shall denote the (monoidal) category of cocontinuous\footnote{I.e. functors that preserve colimits.} (strong) monoidal functors from $\C$ to $\D$ which preserve compact objects (should they exist in $\C$, that is).
                    \end{enumerate}
